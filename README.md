# AI Portfolio — Building Intelligent Systems in Public

Welcome to my AI portfolio — a growing collection of hands-on projects documenting my transition from 3D fashion design into AI, automation, and agent-based system development.

This space serves as both a technical playground and a public learning journal, where I continuously explore how intelligent workflows can be designed, evaluated, and deployed in real-world scenarios.

I’m building these systems in public — sharing not only outcomes, but also experiments, iterations, and architectural thinking along the way.

## 🧭 Portfolio Focus

My work centers around applied AI and agentic workflows, with an emphasis on building systems that are not only functional, but operationally meaningful.

**Key areas include:**

- Agent-based automation systems  
- LLM orchestration & evaluation loops  
- AI-assisted communication workflows  
- Data analysis & visualization projects  
- Practical tool integrations (APIs, notifications, pipelines)  

Rather than isolated models, I focus on designing **end-to-end workflows** — from input handling to output delivery.
